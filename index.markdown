[PyData](https://pydata.org/) is an educational program of [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org/), a 501(c)3 non-profit organization
in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community
of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from
each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices,
new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing,
analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using
many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.

We aim to be an accessible, community-driven conference with novice to advanced
level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest
project features along with cutting-edge use cases.

## Speaking at PyData Delhi Meetups

We're always looking for talks/tutorials/lightning talks which aim to discuss
best practices in data science/engineering/ops, open-source tools/libraries,
data visualisation, computer vision, NLP etc.

If you wish to speak at one of our upcoming meetups, please create an issue on
our GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/pydatadelhi/talks/issues).

Please try to create the issue at least a week before the actual meetup date so
that reviewers have sufficient time to go through your proposal.


## Volunteering @ PyData Delhi

A group of volunteers organises PyData Delhi monthly meetups and conferences.
Since 2016, we have always strived to provide quality discussions, talks and
workshops to our community.

The PyData Delhi team consists of humble volunteers who organise the logistics
of the meetups and conferences. The organising team works full time on their
daily jobs and dedicates their free time to the community.

We're always looking for volunteers to join our team. If you're interested in
helping out please reach out to us on [delhi@pydata.org](mailto:delhi@pydata.org)
or have a chat with the organising team at one of our meetups.
